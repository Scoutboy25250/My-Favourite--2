      My favourite hobby is Showjumping because I feel free when I am on the back of a horse. I feel like I am one with the wind and my horse. I would not even know what horse riding was if it was not for my father. When he was in school, he used to love showjumping. He even made a very special bond with a horse called Armanac. He has told us all about Armanac and how wonderful he is. Aramanac has long since passed away but we feel like he is here with us in spirit. My father also introduced me to showjumping. I felt like it was my calling. I love showjumping and I usually do it 3 times a week. When I am on the back of a horse I learn how to be patient, understanding, brave, and supportive. Not many people do horse riding these days because we used horse riding as a mode of transport and nowadays we have cars. But horseriding is also a discipline and your horse is your teacher. And you have to always trust your teacher.
